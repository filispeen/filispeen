## About me

I'm just a guy standing in front of a keyboard, asking it to code itself.

Sometimes I write code that **works**.
Sometimes I write code that **motivates** me to work harder next time.

Either way...  
**POWER IS EVERYTHING.**

## Motivation? Motivation.

They ask:  
**"Where do you get your motivation?"**

I answer:
